Tower of Psych, or "tops" for short, is s a project started by Ben Heasly in July of 2009.  It aims to facilitate the design and development of [psychophysics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychophysics) tasks in [Matlab](http://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab/).

The big idea is that lots of psychophysics tasks have lots of organization in common, and this organization should be modeled explicitly with classes.  Once a model is in place, a lot of data collection can be automated (i.e. what happened, when?) and graphical interfaces can present task structure visually.

See the [ComponentsAndConcepts](ComponentsAndConcepts.md) page for more about Tower of Psych and what it does.

The [Installation](Installation.md) page can help you install Tower of Psych and get started.

Tower of Psych has a companion project called [Snow Dots](http://snow-dots.googlecode.com/) which implements nuts-and-bolts details that are beyond the scope of Tower of Psych.

As of April 2012, Tower of Psych is at Version 1.  Version 1 represents a few years of development and a bunch of polishing for the code, documentation, and project site.  Version 1 should be functional and stable.

There are no current plans for Version 2.
