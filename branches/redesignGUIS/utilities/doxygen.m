% @section intro Introduction
% @par
% Tower of Psych, or "tops" for short, is s a project started by Ben Heasly
% in July of 2009.  It aims to facilitate the design and development of
% psychophysics experiments in Matlab.
% @par
% The idea is that a lot of psychophysics experiments have a lot of
% organization in common, and this organization should be modeled
% explicitly with classes.  With the model in place, a lot of data
% collection can be automated (i.e. what happened, when?) and graphical
% interfaces can present experiment structure visually.
% @par
% Tower of Psych does not attempt to solve specific research problems like
% stimulus generation or model fitting.  Rather, these problems should be
% solved myopically by individuals and libraries like Psychtoolbox.  Then
% tops should integrate their solutions.
% @par
% The companion project [http://snow-dots.googlecode.com Snow Dots] extends
% Tower of Psych by adding the nuts and bolts (i.e. myopic solutions) for
% running real, tangible experiments.
