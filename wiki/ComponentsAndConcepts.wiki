#summary Intro to Components and Concepts of Tower of Psych

Here are the major components and concepts that Tower of Psych uses to support psychophysics tasks.

<wiki:toc max_depth="4" />

=Concepts=

===Object-Oriented===
"handle" since Matlab 2008a

===High-Level Integration===
Not myopic, specific behaviors
Experiments run on built-in Matlab only (though tests, docs, and graphs use externals, and GUIs use undocumented Swing stuff)

===Fevalable functions===
vs anonymous: viewable, mutable, seem to perform better with Matlab's handle reference scheme

{{{
% fevalable
foo = {@disp, 'abracadabra'};
feval(foo{:});

% anonymous function
foo = @() disp('abracadabra');
feval(foo);
}}}

===Testing===

=Components=

===Runnables===
Tree-like flow
Concurrency

===GUIs===
Some undocumented stuff

===Graphing===
Uses GraphViz
http://www.graphviz.org/

===Spatial Classification===
Indexes big matrices

===Logging===
Uses singleton and static methods
