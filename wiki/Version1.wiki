#summary Goals and progress towards Version 1!

I'm going to try for a major revision, called Version 1.  I expect to finish it by April, 2012.  My big goals for 1.0 are:

  * Good agreement among project areas, including code base, documentation, and project site.
  * Resolution of outstanding project issues, removal of stale issues
  * Good explanation of project components, and how to access components individually, without requiring [http://idioms.thefreedictionary.com/whole+enchilada the whole enchilada]
  * Installer to easily get Version 1 by name (no need to know about repository tags, trunk etc.)
  * Expectation of long-term stability

This page contains my laundry list of changes to Tower of Psych.

<wiki:toc max_depth="4" />

===January2010===
The first goal is to complete the changes in the January2012 milestone.

===GUIs===
The topsGUI code evolved into a mess.  I want to clean it up so that it can become more useful.

  * ScrollingControlGrid -> topsControlGrid
  * Need to refactor GUI code for use cases and clarity, cause it's a mess
  * Fewer GUIs?
  * GUIs need to show relevant data, rather than automatic data
  * Make awesome "pueblo" color scheme
  * Figure out how to re-summarize text, as widget resizes
 (big - 3 days)

===Member Access===
  * I want to agree across the code base on on hidden vs. protected member access, as a point of code style

===Demos===
  * Move encounter/ and spots/ into tasks/ folder
 (small)

===Foundation===
  * EventWithData -> topsEvent

===Utilities===
Several of the utilities/ functions can be cleaned up or organized

  * Retain spacedColors, but implement "pueblo" as well
  * summarizeValue may truncate internally
  * bench* -> benchmark*, retain all as points of interest

===Tests===
  * Rename tests to agree with 1.0

The wiki should be filled out and brought into agreement with the code and docs
