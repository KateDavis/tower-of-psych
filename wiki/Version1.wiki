#summary Goals and progress towards Version 1!

I'm aiming for a major revision, called Version 1.  I expect to finish it by April, 2012.  My big goals for 1.0 are:

  * Good agreement among project areas, including code base, documentation, and project site.
  * Resolution of outstanding project issues, removal of stale issues
  * Good explanation of project components, and how to access components individually, without requiring [http://idioms.thefreedictionary.com/whole+enchilada the whole enchilada]
  * Installer to easily get Version 1 by name (no need to know about repository tags, trunk etc.)
  * Expectation of long-term stability

This page contains my laundry list of changes to Tower of Psych.

<wiki:toc max_depth="4" />

===January2010===
The first goal is to complete the changes in the [January2012] milestone.

===GUIs===
The topsGUI code evolved into a mess.  I want to clean it up so that it can become more useful.

  * ScrollingControlGrid -> topsControlGrid
  * Need to refactor GUI code for use cases and clarity, cause it's a mess
  * Fewer GUIs?
  * GUIs need to show relevant data, rather than automatic data
  * Make awesome "pueblo" color scheme
  * Figure out how to re-summarize text, as widget resizes
 (big - 3 days)

===Code Style===
Class members that are intuitively "internal" to a class should all use the SetAccess = protected or Access = protected modifier.  That way members are viewable but won't get messed with by accident.  Now, there's a mix of access modifiers and hidden status, for no good reason.

topsFoundation subclasses should all take a "name" argument in their constructors.  Matlab makes this a pain in the neck because it requires such a constructor to be cut and pasted.  But I think it's worth having a name appear in the same line where an object is created, to make code easy to scan

===Demos===
I want move encounter/ and spots/ demos into a tasks/ folder
 (small)

===Foundation===
I want to rename EventWithData -> topsEvent
 (small)

===Utilities===
Several of the utilities/ functions can be cleaned up or organized.

  * Retain spacedColors, but implement "pueblo" as well
  * summarizeValue may truncate internally
  * "bench_" -> "benchmark_", retain all as points of interest
  * "Grapher" -> "tops_Grapher"
  * "GrapherSandbox" -> "demo_Grapher", comment, move to demos/graphing/
 (small)

===Tests===
Some unit tests need renaming.

  * Rename tests to agree with 1.0
  * TestStringifyValue -> TestSummarizeValue
 (small)

===Wiki===
The wiki should be filled out and brought into agreement with the code and docs.

  * Replace aboutTowerOfPsych with ComponentsAndConcepts page
    * component descriptions
    * checkout links for component folders
    * sweet diagram
 (big - 1 day)

===Docs===
The role and form of the Doxygen docs should be tweaked.

  * Doc front page as TOC, not as intro
  * Focus on classes and functions as API/reference
  * Remove confusing nav tabs
 (small)

===Issues===
The issues database has become stale and irrelevant.

  * Close issues solved in 1.0
  * _No-Solve other issues with a note (did on 8 Jan)_
 (small)

===Main Page===
The project main page should be updated.

  * Short intro, components
  * Short status
  * Link to aboutTowerOfPsych wiki page
  * Shouts out to related projects
  * Check out link for Version 1
