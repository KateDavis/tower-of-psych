#summary Tower of Psych milestones for January 2012

"January2012" will be the third formal milestone for the Tower of Psych project.  It will correspond to the repository tag called January2012:
{{{
http://tower-of-psych.googlecode.com/svn/tags/January2012
}}}

[http://tower-of-psych.googlecode.com/svn-history/r632/documentation/html/index.html Documentation contemporary with January2012] will be available.

January2012 will receive bug fixes, but new API and feature changes will go in the trunk, to be included in a later milestone.

*Note: this repository tag doesn't exist yet, but it will in January.*

===Overview===
January2012 implements two features: classification for spatial data, and aggregation of objects into groups for doing operations in batches.

===Classification===
Tower of Psych will implement classes for modeling and classifying spatial data (or any data treated as spatial).

  * topsDimension will model a discrete, finite spatial dimensions
  * topsSpace will aggregate Dimensions to define a discrete, finite space
  * topsRegion will model a region within a Space
  * topsClassification will classify spatial data based on Regions within a Space

topsStateMachine will make use of topsClassification.  Each state may have its own Classification, allowing it to respond to inputs in a state-dependent way.  This functionality will supplement state input functions.

StateMachineGrapher will be able to "peek" at Classifications used by topsStateMachine, in order to produce rich graphs.

===Grouping===
Tower of Psych will also implement object grouping behavior.

  * topsGroup will aggregate arbitrary objects and do member access and invocation in batches.

It will be up to users to group objects together that have members in common.

Aggregated objects won't have to know anything about topsGroup or how grouping is accomplished.  Aggregated objects may be referred to by topsGroup instance, and an internal key or index.
